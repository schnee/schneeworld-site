```{r image, fig.width = 6, fig.height=1, echo=FALSE}
library(mondrian)
par(mfrow=c(1,1), mar=rep(1,4))
compose()
```

[Jean Fan](https://github.com/JEFworks) created an [R function](https://jef.works/art-with-code/portfolio/20180720_mondrian/) to generate artwork in the style of [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian). I thought this is brilliant and turned the code into an R package: `devtools::install_github("schnee/mondrian")`. 

The image at the top was generated via Jean's code.
